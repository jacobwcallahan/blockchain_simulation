So with the limit on neighbors, are these neighbors two ways? Like if node 1 is a neighbor of node 2, does that mean node 2 is also a neighbor of node 1?

Does each miner have one node? And does each miner have one wallet?

Since the hash rate for all the miners is the same, 
I divided the difficulty by the hashrate and only found one number per miner. This number was the time to mine. 
Is this alright? it saved me significant time running the simulation
