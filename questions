So with the limit on neighbors, are these neighbors two ways? Like if node 1 is a neighbor of node 2, does that mean node 2 is also a neighbor of node 1?

Does each miner have one node? And does each miner have one wallet?

!!! We determine the time taken for blocks to be mined by the random chance of hitting a hash correct?
This is essentially uniformly distributed odds, 
but the actual bitcoin mining times are not uniformly distributed around the expected time, 
they are (relatively) normally distributed, or at least distributed between 8 and 12 minutes.
How can I do that?
